    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The thing that I am working toward in my life is to be the state champion for pole vault for the second year in a row. It would be good to be able to represent my high school by winning states back to back. Some things that I do in my day to day life to accomplish this goal is exercise. There is not a day that goes by where I don't do at least some form of physical labor. A value that I consider most necessary for my success is dedication. Without it, I would have been left behind by the competition long ago. I become better because I train while they sleep. Where there is no dedication, there is no success. One short term goal that I hope to accomplish is to get all A's on my report card as I did in the first quarter. I want to be known for my positive attitude and the fact that I don't quit till the job is done.</p>
